Kaizen events are typically brief, focused improvement projects where people, including the management team, participate in analyzing their Value Stream Map (VSM) to solve a specific problem. While daily Kaizen projects may be small in scope or somewhat spontaneous, a Kaizen event demands thoughtful planning by team leaders involved. "

Unlike Kaizen, which focuses on incremental changes, Kaikaku describes a process where an entire organization is focused on a radical process transformation. Rather than improving a process, Kaikaku may demand the organization moves to an entirely new process. Examples of Kaikaku might include moving from manual to automated production or embarking on a digital transformation that drives workplace collaboration."

It’s about the big break-through that changes everything. While Kaikaku might mean making a major change in how things are done, Kakushin might be about changing what is done. For example, if Kaikaku is about moving from manual to automated production, Kakushin would be the switch to 3D printing those materials, demanding new skills from the workforce."
